IT-Explorations Class Overview 

In my IT Explorations class, I learned the foundations concepts of information technology, including hardware, software, and operating systems. I started with very little experience, but over time I gained valuable knowledge and confidence through hands on practices. The class introduced me to some key areas such as Command Prompt, Files Management, Virtualization, and GitHub usage. This class also challenged me to apply critical thinking and teamwork skills when completing labs and projects. One thing that truly surprised me was discoveri ng how broad the IT field is and that there is so many career paths beyond just IT-Help Desk roles. This class has helped me see and understand the fundamentals of an operating system and computer components that will help strenghten my foundations for becoming a Data Analyst.
